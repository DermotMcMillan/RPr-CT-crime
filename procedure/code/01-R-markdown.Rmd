# Study design

This is a replication of a study on crime and contextual characteristics in Connecticut. The original study uses geographically weighted regression to test how crime rates at the county subdivision level vary based on several socio-demographic characteristics. 

The original study is observational using socio-demographic indicators from the Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year estimates and crime data from the Uniform Crime Report disseminated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

We will attempt to use the same methods and data sources as the original authors to see if there is any variation in our results or missing methods in their research.

# Materials and procedure

## Computational environment

```{r environment-setup, include = FALSE}
# record all the packages you are using here
# this includes any calls to library(), require(),
# and double colons such as here::i_am()
packages <- c("tidyverse", "here", "sf", "tidycensus", "tmap", "tigris")

# force all conflicts to become errors
# if you load dplyr and use filter(), R has to guess whether you mean dplyr::filter() or stats::filter()
# the conflicted package forces you to be explicit about this
# disable at your own peril
# https://conflicted.r-lib.org/
require(conflicted)

# load and install required packages
# https://groundhogr.com/
if (!require(groundhog)) {
  install.packages("groundhog")
  require(groundhog)
}

# this date will be used to determine the versions of R and your packages
# it is best practice to keep R and its packages up to date
groundhog.day <- "2025-03-25"

# this replaces any library() or require() calls
groundhog.library(packages, groundhog.day)
# you may need to install a correct version of R
# you may need to respond OK in the console to permit groundhog to install packages
# you may need to restart R and rerun this code to load installed packages
# In RStudio, restart r with Session -> Restart Session

# record the R processing environment
# alternatively, use devtools::session_info() for better results
writeLines(
  capture.output(sessionInfo()),
  here("procedure", "environment", paste0("r-environment-", Sys.Date(), ".txt"))
)

# save package citations
knitr::write_bib(c(packages, "base"), file = here("software.bib"))

# set up default knitr parameters
# https://yihui.org/knitr/options/
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE, # Show outputs, but not code. Change to TRUE to show code as well
  fig.retina = 4,
  fig.width = 8,

## Prior observations  



## Bias and threats to validity

The thread specifically relevant to this problem is the Modifiable Unit Area Problem. There are also potential sources of error related to endogeneity and spatial auto-correlation both of which are somewhat accounted for in the original study. Additionally, the results do not have predictive power because the GWR is too regionally specific and over fit. Instead these results can be interpreted as exploratory requiring more rigorous research to contextualize and verify any findings. 

## Data transformations / analysis

There are several methodological choices that the original authors did not specify, and which we will have to figure out by comparing results and summary statistics. Specifically, we need to choose a spatial weights matrix for the GWR. We will start with the default ArcGIS spatial matrii (since they used the ArcGIS tool for their analysis) and go from there. If we cannot figure out which one they used we will chose our own and compare results.
